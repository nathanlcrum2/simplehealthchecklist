			Modern society, with all its benefits, is an unnatural environment
			for humans causing a decline in health. In addition, greed and
			corruption in many industries has led to the sale of food, drugs,
			and products that are harmful to us. This is especially true in
			the United States.
	
			With such corruption it is unwise to blindly trust experts,
			government agencies or corporate marketing. Since most people don’t have decades
			to learn and conduct health experiments, we must rely on
			common sense and some heuristics.
			If you follow these four heuristics you will be much healthier.
			<br>
			<br>
			&emsp;1. Ask yourself, how did we evolve?<br>
			&emsp;2. If it doesn’t grow, then it isn’t food.<br>
			&emsp;3. It is unhealthy, unless proven to be healthy.<br>
			&emsp;4. Anything that is not natural, is likely not healthy.<br>
			<br>
			
			
			The checklist I have provided is based on these principles,
			and is meant to give you a simple way to track your progress
			as you build a healthier lifestyle. Of course, it goes without saying
			that we cannot avoid everything that is artificial or unhealthy,
			but in general I think the list is a good start.
			<br><br>
			With this checklist you are going to build a more natural
			environment for yourself. Your top value in life is now health.
			It comes above all else. You embody it. Your actions embody it.
			Your habits prove it to yourself and those around you. Never quit.
